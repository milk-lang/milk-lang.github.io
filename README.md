This webpage uses Github pages's [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
support to turn Markdown files combined with
[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) code into served html
pages. To update it we recommend you [install
Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) locally so that you can test your
changes locally before submitting a pull request.
